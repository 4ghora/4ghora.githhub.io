Ensure your mobile device is patched and updated.
	
## 2. SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)
	
### SIM:
+ Subscriber Identity Module.
+ Its integrated circuit that securely stores the International Mobile Subscriber Identity(IMSI) number and its related key.
	
### SIM Cloning:
+ Allows 2 phones to utilize the same service and allows an attacker to gai access to the phone's data.
+ SIMv1 cards were very easy to clone but newer SIMv2 cards are much harder.
	
## 3. Bluetooth Attacks
	
### Blue-Jacking:
+ Sending of unsolicited messages to bluetooth enabled devices.
+ Sends information to a device
	
### Blue-Snarfing:
+ Unauthorized access of information from a wireless device over a bluetooth connection.
+ takes information from a device

### Preventions
+ Change Default keys
+ turn off if not in use
+ Turn off discoverable mode

## 4. Mobile Device Theft
+ Always Ensure device backup
+ use full disk encryption

5. do not jain-break and root
6. only use v2 sim cards
7. turn off unncessary services
8. turn on encryption for voice and data
9. use strong password and biometrics
10. do not allow `BYOD`
