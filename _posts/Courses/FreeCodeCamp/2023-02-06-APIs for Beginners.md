What is an API? Learn all about APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in this full tutorial for beginners. You will learn what APIs do, why APIs exist, and the many benefits of APIs. APIs are used all the time in programming and web development so it is important to understand how to use them.

## Unit 1 - What is an API?
### Introduction
+ Application Programming Interface

### Defining Interface
+ Interface allows us to control the way an application works through the options that ae exposed
+ Interface evolves throughout time
+ Interfaces Abstracts away the implementations
+ Ui made for the User
+ Api is made for the application programmer
  
### Defining API
+ defines how it should be used and what you  can expect by using it
+ set of tools designed for software developers
+ helps by proving abstraction of the implementation
+ basically pre build code which can be used when needed for cross platform execution and implementation
+ Code can be written for web and it works on all browser, it is because of the set of Web Api's which every browser must implement.

### Remote APIs
+ Receives data from a remote place processes it and then sends it back.
+ **The path to remote APIs**
  + SOAP (formerly a ackronym for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

### How The Web Works
+  Client uses url(universal resource locator) aka URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) to connect to the server.
+  protocols are used to communicate in different forms to the server, like http/s for web pages and ftp for accessing a file.
+  GET requests will only receive data and Post will deliver or change some data.
+  server responds contain html which is rendered out on the web browser 
+  when a link is click same process repeats.

### Restful APIs
+ REST (Representational State Transfer)
+ API's that meet rest architectural style constraints are considered to be restful
+ RESTful API Constraints
  1. Client-Server Architecture 
     + Client like program send data to the server
  2. Statelessness
     + packet sent is stateless(server wont remember you) 
  3. Cacheability
  4. Layered Systems
  5. Code on Demand
  6. Uniform Interface
