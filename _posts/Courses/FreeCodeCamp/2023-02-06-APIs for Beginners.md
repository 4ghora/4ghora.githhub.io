What is an API? Learn all about APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in this full tutorial for beginners. You will learn what APIs do, why APIs exist, and the many benefits of APIs. APIs are used all the time in programming and web development so it is important to understand how to use them.

## Unit 1 - What is an API?
### Introduction
+ Application Programming Interface

### Defining Interface
+ Interface allows us to control the way an application works through the options that ae exposed
+ Interface evolves throughout time
+ Interfaces Abstracts away the implementations
+ Ui made for the User
+ Api is made for the application programmer
  
### Defining API
+ defines how it should be used and what you  can expect by using it
+ set of tools designed for software developers
+ helps by proving abstraction of the implementation
+ basically pre build code which can be used when needed for cross platform execution and implementation
+
