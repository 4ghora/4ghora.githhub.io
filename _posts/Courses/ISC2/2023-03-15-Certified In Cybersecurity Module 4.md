## Module 1: Understand Computer Networking
### What is Networking
+ A network is simply two or more computers linked together to share data, information or resources.

### Types of Networks
+ **Local area network (LAN)** - A local area network (LAN) is a network typically spanning a single floor or building.
+ **Wide area network (WAN)** - Wide area network (WAN) is the term usually assigned to the long-distance connections between geographically remote networks.

### Network Devices
+ `Hub`
  + Hubs are used to connect multiple devices in a network. Theyâ€™re less likely to be seen in business or corporate networks than in home networks. 

+ `Switch`
  + Switches are wired devices that know the addresses of the devices connected to them and route traffic to that port/device rather than retransmitting to all devices.

+ `Router`
  + Routers are used to control traffic flow on networks and are often used to connect similar networks and control traffic flow between them.

+ `Firewall`
  + Firewalls are essential tools in managing and controlling network traffic and protecting the network. A firewall is a network device used to filter traffic.
  + deployed between a private network and the internet

+ `Server`
  + computer that provides information to other computers on a network.

+ Endpoints
  + Endpoints are the ends of a network communication link. One end is often at a server where a resource resides, and the other end is often a client making a request to use a network resource.

### Other Networking Terms
+ `Ethernet`
  + Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is a standard that defines wired connections of networked devices.

+ `Device ``Address`
  + **Media Access Control (MAC) Address**
    + Every network device is assigned a Media Access Control (MAC) address.
    + 3 bytes (24bits)
  + **Internet Protocol (IP) Address**
    + IP hosts associate that address with a unique logical address.
    +  logical IP address represents the network interface within the network and can be useful to maintain communications
