## Introduction
---
+ Microsoft's Active Directory backbone of corporates


## Windows Domains
---
+ Group of users and computers under the administration of business
+ Centralised the administration of common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called **Active Directory (AD)**

+ Advantages
  + Centralized Identity system
    + All Users can be managed by central location (Eas/Peasy)
  + Managing Security Policies
    + Configure Security policies and apply from centralized location across location
  
### Questions
1. In a Windows domain, credentials are stored in a centralised repository called... 
+ Active Directory
  
2. The server in charge of running the Active Directory services is called…
+ Domain Controller
  
## Active Directory
---
+ Core of every Domain Controller

### Components
+ **Users**
  + Users are objects known as security principals, can be authenticated by the domain and can be assigned privileges over resources like files or printers
  + **Types**
    + People : users will generally represent persons in your organisation (Employees)
    + Services: can also define users to be used by services like IIS or MSSQL. Every single service requires a user to run, but service users are different from regular users as they will only have the privileges needed to run their specific service.
+ **Machines**
    + another type of object within Active Directory
    + for every computer that joins the Active Directory domain, a machine object will be created.
    + limited rights within domain
    + machine accounts are local administrators on the assigned computer
    + not supposed to be accessed by anyone except the computer
    + Can be accessed if you have the password
    + Machine Account passwords are automatically rotated out and are generally comprised of 120 random characters.
    + Easy to identify
    + a machine named DC01 will have a machine account called **DC01$**

+ **Security Group**
    + user groups are used to assign access rights to files or other resources to entire groups instead of single users.
    + Security groups are also considered security principals and, therefore, can have privileges over resources on the network.
    + Groups can have both users and machines as members.
    + here are some of the most important groups in a domain:

|Security Group         |Description                                     |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
|**Domain Admins**  |Users of this group have administrative privileges over the entire domain. By default, they can administer any computer on the domain, including the DCs.|
|**Server Operators**|Users in this group can administer Domain Controllers. They cannot change any administrative group memberships.|
|**Backup Operators**|Users in this group are allowed to access any file, ignoring their permissions. They are used to perform backups of data on computers.
|
|**Account Operators**|Users in this group can create or modify other accounts in the domain.|
|**Domain Users**|Includes all existing user accounts in the domain.|
|**Domain Computers**|Includes all existing computers in the domain.|
|**Domain Controllers**|Includes all existing DCs on the domain.|

+ **Active Directory Users and Computers**
  + To configure users, groups or machines log in to the Domain Controller and run Active Directory Users and Computers ins tart menu
  + **Organizational Units (OUs)** are container objects that allow you to classify users and machines.
  + OUs are mainly used to define sets of users with similar policing requirements.
  + These containers are created by Windows automatically and contain the following:
    + **Builtin**: Contains default groups available to any Windows host.
    + **Computers**: Any machine joining the network will be put here by default. You can move them if needed.
    + **Domain Controllers**: Default OU that contains the DCs in your network.
    + **Users**: Default users and groups that apply to a domain-wide context.
    + **Managed Service Accounts**: Holds accounts used by services in your Windows domain.
+ **Security Groups vs Ous**
  + OUs are handy for applying policies to users and computers, which include specific configurations that pertain to sets of users depending on their particular role in the enterprise.
  + **Security Groups**, on the other hand, are used to grant permissions over resources.

### Questions
1. Which group normally administrates all computers and resources in a domain?
+ Domain Admins

2. What would be the name of the machine account associated with a machine named TOM-PC?
+ TOM-PC$
  
3. Suppose our company creates a new department for Quality Assurance. What type of containers should we use to group all Quality Assurance users so that policies can be applied consistently to them?
+ Organizational Units

## Managing Users in AD
---

+ AD/DS -> View -> Advanced Features -> right click on the OU -> go to properties -> objects tab -> Be sure to uncheck the box and try deleting the OU again -> delete
+ **Delegation**
  + in AD you can give specific users some control over some Ous known as delegation and allows you to grant users specific privileges to perform advanced tasks on OUs without needing a Domain Administrator.
  
### Questions
1. What was the flag found on Sophie's desktop? 
+ THM{thanks_for_contacting_support}
2. The process of granting privileges to a user over some OU or other AD Object is called... 
+ delegation

## **Managing Computers in AD**
---
  + By default, all the machines that join a domain (except for the DCs) will be put in the container called "Computers".
  + In general, you'd expect to see devices divided into at least the three following categories:
    + **Workstations** : Workstations are one of the most common devices within an Active Directory domain. Each user in the domain will likely be logging into a workstation.
    + **Servers** : generally used to provide services to other servers
    + **Domain Controllers** : Allow you to manage the active directory, most sensitive devices

### Questions
1. After organising the available computers, how many ended up in the Workstations OU?
+ 7
2. Is it recommendable to create separate OUs for Servers and Workstations? (yay/nay)
+ yay

## Group Policies
---
+ Group policy objects (GPO)
+ GPOs are simply a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs.
+ contain policies aimed at either users or computers, allowing you to set a baseline on specific machines and identities.
+ To configure GPOs, you can use the Group Policy Management tool
+ **GPO Distribution**
  + GPOs are distributed to the network via a network share called SYSVOL
+ **Creating some GPOs for THM Inc.**
  + As part of our new job, we have been tasked with implementing some GPOs to allow us to:
  1. Block non-IT users from accessing the Control Panel.
  2. Make workstations and servers lock their screen automatically after 5 minutes of user inactivity to avoid people leaving their sessions exposed.

### Questions
1. What is the name of the network share used to distribute GPOs to domain machines?
+ sysvol
2. Can a GPO be used to apply settings to users and computers? (yay/nay)
+ yay

## Authentication Methods
---
+ all credentials are stored in the Domain Controllers
+ Two protocols can be used for network authentication in windows domains:
  + **Kerberos**: Used by any recent version of Windows. This is the default protocol in any recent domain.
  + **NetNTLM**: Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes.
+ ### Kerberos Authentication
  + Kerberos authentication is the default authentication protocol for any recent version of Windows.
  + When Kerberos is used for authentication, the following process happens:
  1. User sends their username and a timestamp encrypted using a key derived from their password to the Key Distribution Center (KDC)

  2. The KDC will create and send back a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which will allow the user to request additional tickets to access specific services.

  3. The TGS can then be sent to the desired service to authenticate and establish a connection. The service will use its configured account's password hash to decrypt the TGS and validate the Service Session Key.

+ **NetNTLM Authentication**
  + NetNTLM works using a challenge-response mechanism
    1. The client sends an authentication request to the server they want to access.
    2. The server generates a random number and sends it as a challenge to the client.
    3. The client combines their NTLM password hash with the challenge (and other known data) to generate a response to the challenge and sends it back to the server for verification.
    4. The server forwards the challenge and the response to the Domain Controller for verification.
    5. The domain controller uses the challenge to recalculate the response and compares it to the original response sent by the client. If they both match, the client is authenticated; otherwise, access is denied. The authentication result is sent back to the server.
    6. The server forwards the authentication result to the client.

 + Note that the user's password (or hash) is never transmitted through the network for security.

### Questions
---
1. Will a current version of Windows use NetNTLM as the preferred authentication protocol by default? (yay/nay)
+ Nay
2. When referring to Kerberos, what type of ticket allows us to request further tickets known as TGS?
+ Ticket Granting Ticket
3. When using NetNTLM, is a user's password transmitted over the network at any point? (yay/nay)
+ Nay

## Trees, Forests and Trusts
---
+ Trees
  + Active Directory supports integrating multiple domains
  + 2 domains with same name space can b joined into a tree
  + If our thm.local domain was split into two subdomains for UK and US branches, you could build a tree with a root domain of thm.local and two subdomains called uk.thm.local and us.thm.local
  + Uk subdomain will have there own domain controller same goes for us subdomain
  + Uk and us sub domains can not interfear in each others domains
  + Each domain would still have its Domain Admins with administrator privileges over their single domains and the Enterprise Admins who can control everything in the enterprise.

+ Forest
  + union of several trees with different namespaces into the same network is known as a **forest**.

+ Trust Relationships
  + Helps in accessing each others resources
	+ Shared Files and folders
	+ direction of the one-way trust relationship is contrary to that of the access direction.
	+ Two-way trust relationships can also be made to allow both domains to mutually authorise users from the other.
	+ By default, joining several domains under a tree or a forest will form a two-way trust relationship.
  + Having a trust relationship between domains doesn't automatically grant access to all resources on other domains

### Questions
1. What is a group of Windows domains that share the same namespace called? 
+ Tree
2. What should be configured between two domains for a user in Domain A to access a resource in Domain B?
+ A Trust Relationship
