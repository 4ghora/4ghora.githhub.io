**Learn how to abuse the Kerberos Ticket Granting Service inside of a Windows Domain Controller**

## Introduction
+ default authentication service for Microsoft Windows domains.
+ more "secure" than NTLM by using third party ticket authorization as well as stronger encryption.

### **Common Terminology**
+ **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT** 
  + ticket-granting ticket is an authentication ticket used to request service tickets from the TGS for specific resources from the domain.
+ **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**
  + Key Distribution Center is a service for issuing TGTs and service tickets that consist of the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service.
+ **Authentication Service (AS)**
  + Authentication Service issues TGTs to be used by the TGS in the domain to request access to other machines and service tickets.
+ **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**
  + Ticket Granting Service takes the TGT and returns a ticket to a machine on the domain.
+ **Service Principal Name (SPN)**
  + Service Principal Name is an identifier given to a service instance to associate a service instance with a domain service account.
+ **KDC Long Term Secret Key (KDC LT Key)**
  + KDC key is based on the KRBTGT service account. It is used to encrypt the TGT and sign the PAC.
+ **Client Long Term Secret Key (Client LT Key)**
  + client key is based on the computer or service account. It is used to check the encrypted timestamp and encrypt the session key.
+ **Service Long Term Secret Key (Service LT Key)**
  + service key is based on the service account. It is used to encrypt the service portion of the service ticket and sign the PAC.
+ **Session Key**
  + Issued by the KDC when a TGT is issued. The user will provide the session key to the KDC along with the TGT when requesting a service ticket.
+ **Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC)**
  + The PAC holds all of the user's relevant information, it is sent along with the TGT to the KDC to be signed by the Target LT Key and the KDC LT Key in order to validate the user.

### AS-REQ w/ Pre-Authentication In Detail
+  validate the user and create a TGT for the user,
   +  user must encrypt a timestamp NT hash and send it to the AS
   +  The KDC attempts to decrypt the timestamp using the NT hash from the user
      +  if successful the KDC will issue a TGT as well as a session key for the user.

### Ticket Granting Ticket Contents
+ the TGT is provided by the user to the KDC
+ the KDC validates the TGT and returns a service ticket.

### Service Ticket Contents
+ Service Portion: User Details, Session Key, Encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash.
+ User Portion: Validity Timestamp, Session Key, Encrypts with the TGT session key.

+ AS-REQ - 1.) The client requests an Authentication Ticket or Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).
+ AS-REP - 2.) The Key Distribution Center verifies the client and sends back an encrypted TGT.
+ TGS-REQ - 3.) The client sends the encrypted TGT to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service the client wants to access. 
+ TGS-REP - 4.) The Key Distribution Center (KDC) verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service, then sends a valid session key for the service to the client.
+ AP-REQ - 5.) The client requests the service and sends the valid session key to prove the user has access.
+ AP-REP - 6.) The service grants access

### Kerberos Tickets Overview
+ ticket is typically base64 encoded and can be used for various attacks.
+ ticket-granting ticket is only used with the KDC in order to get service tickets.
+ KRBTGT allows you to get any service ticket that you want allowing you to access anything on the domain that you want.

### Attack Privilege Requirements
+ Kerbrute Enumeration - No domain access required 
+ Pass the Ticket - Access as a user to the domain required
+ Kerberoasting - Access as any user required
+ AS-REP Roasting - Access as any user required
+ Golden Ticket - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required 
+ Silver Ticket - Service hash required
+ Skeleton Key - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required

### Questions
1. What does TGT stand for?
+ Ticket Granting Ticket
2. What does SPN stand for?
+ Service Principal Name
3. What does PAC stand for?
+ Privilege Attribute Certificate
4. What two services make up the KDC?
+ AS, TGS

## Enumeration w/ Kerbrute 
+ enumeration tool used to brute-force and enumerate valid active-directory users by abusing the Kerberos pre-authentication.


### Kerbrute Installation
1. Download a precompiled binary for your OS <https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases>
2. Rename kerbrute_linux_amd64 to kerbrute
3. make kerbrute executable
```bash
chmod +x kerbrute
```

### Enumerating Users w/ Kerbrute
1. cd into the directory that you put Kerbrute
2. Download the wordlist
3. This will brute force user accounts from a domain controller using a supplied wordlist
```bash
./kerbrute userenum --dc CONTROLLER.local -d CONTROLLER.local User.txt
```

### Questions
1. How many total users do we enumerate?
+ 10
2. What is the SQL service account name?
+ sqlservice
3. What is the second "machine" account name?
+ machine2
